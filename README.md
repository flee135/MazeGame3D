# MazeGame3D
Implementation of maze race game using Unity engine.

In single player, the goal of each run is to activate the portal by collecting the key, and then reaching the portal to stop the time. The portal and the key will always be in one of eight locations, either the corners of the maze or on the middle of one of the edges of the maze. The portal and the key will never be in the same location. The player will always start in the center of the maze on each run.
